fixhs - FIX engine implementation in Haskell


TODO:
- Setup QuickCheck test cases
- Implement FIX groups 
- Implement FIX deserialization or co-parsing
- Use of an iteratee for reading from the socket, or maybe make use as well of attoparsec-iteratee (See monad reader issue 16 about iteratees)
- Benchmarks using Criterion
- Comparison with quickfix engine
